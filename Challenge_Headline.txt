Using Python3, solve the following:

    Reverse a String in two different ways:

        Using iteration

        Using recursion

    Give an example of each filter and reduce over an iterable object.


Open questions:

    Research what is available and design an error-handling tool to report errors occurring in the frontend of a system. The frontend of this system is written in JavaScript and uses a strict API to the Rails backend. 


How would you implement this?
